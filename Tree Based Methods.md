# Tree Based Methods

Decision trees can be applied to both regression and classification problems, here we will discuss both and highlight potential pros & cons.

### Pros and Cons
- Simple and useful for interpretation.
- Typically not competitive wit the best supervised learning approaches in terms of prediction accuracy.
- [[Bagging]], [[Random Forests]] and [[Boosting]] are methods which grow multiple trees and then combined into a single consensus prediction.
- Combing trees often result in improved prediction accuracy, at the expense of interpret-ability.
