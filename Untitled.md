# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a production-ready, open source container orchestration package. It enables containerised applications to be available 24/7 and manage the resource the application has access to.

### Kubernetes Clusters
Kubernetes will coordinate highly available clusters which are connected to work together. It will automate the distribution and scheduling of the application container across a cluster of many machines.

A cluster will consist of two types of resource:
- The **Control Plane** which coordinates the cluster
- **Nodes** are teh workers that run applications
