# Hopfield Networks

Hopfield networks, are [[Recurrent Neural Networks]] capable of storing and retrieving multiple memories. First described by John Hopfield in 1982, they were the first instance of associative networks: RNN architectures which are capable of producing an emergent associative memory. Associative memory, or content-addressable memory, is a system in which memory recall is initiated by the associativity of an input pattern to a memorised one. In other words, associative memory allows for retrieval ab completion of a memory using only an incomplete or noisy portion of it.
