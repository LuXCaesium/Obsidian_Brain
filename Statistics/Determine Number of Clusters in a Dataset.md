# Determining the Number of Clusters in a Dataset

Often, especially when using clustering algorithms, we want to determine the number of clusters in a dataset. Often labelled $k$ we want to find this quantity which is vital for algorithms such as k-means etc. Other algorithms such as **DBSCAN** and **OPTICS** do not require such a specification. 

## Elbow Method

## X-means Clustering

## Information criterion
