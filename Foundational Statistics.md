# Foundational Statistics

**Random Experiment:** an experiment whose outcome cannot be determined in advance.

These experiments are modelled as triplets $(\Omega, \mathcal{H}, \mathbb{P})$ where:
- **Sample Space:** $\Omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
- **Event Space:** $\mathcal{H}$ is the collection of all subsets of $\Omega$ to which a probability can be assigned.
- **Probability Measure:**  $\mathbb{P}$ is a function assigning to each event $\mathcal{A}$ a number $\mathbb{P}[A}]$
