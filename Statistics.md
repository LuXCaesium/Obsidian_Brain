# Statistics

This page highlights the main topics and structure of the Statistics field. Here we will list relevant pages and structure the content in a way to make it accessible to link ideas across disciplines. I could have included most, if not all the topics here under Data Science, however I will refrain and this page will include some academic works not included into the general practices of Data Science.

## Probability
[[Copula]]
[[Directed Graphs and Conditional Independence]]
## Classical Statistics
## Bayesian Probability
[[Bayesian Inference]]
