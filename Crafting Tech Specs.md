# Crafting Tech Specs

A Tech Specs document, is a detailed description to outline the technical and functional aspects of a product feature, system or project. This is meant to provide clear and comprehensive information about technical requirements and guidelines.

This includes:

- üéØ **Clarity of Vision**: Provide clear understanding of what needs to be built, ensuring everyone is working toward the same goals.
- üîó **Better Communication**: Common language between team, helping bridge the gap between technical & non-technical stakeholders.
- üöß **Risk Mitigation**: Detailed specs to help identify potential issues early, and plan ways to mitigate them.
- üìà **Efficiency in Development**: With a well defined plan, development is smoother, as developers have a clear road map to follow.
- üîç **Quality Assurance**: Define quality standards, guiding testing to ensure the final product meets all requirements.


## Crafting the Document

### Process
There are three main phases for crafting tech specs:

- **Collect**: all requirements are collected into a *Requirements Document*. Take a design-first approach and initial designs/wireframes should be included.
- **Assess**: engineering team & stakeholders review requirements for clarity & alignment with potential technical solutions. A live Tech Specs draft is created to document findings & proposed solutions.
- **Agree**: following the output of the previous phase, when the full doc is ready, its time to agree and start the implementation 

### Structure

- **Heading**: include all metadata such as the author, the reviewer, the last modification date, status, teams involved and more.
- **Project Overview**: Concise and provide context for the document readers. Touch on the problem statement, goals and non-goals.
- **Proposed Solution**: describe how the team intends to solve the problem. It's a high-level description of the solution your team plans to adopt.
- **Alternative Solutions**: list other solutions and explain why they were discarded.
- **Implementation**: core of the technical document. Include all technical details, tech stack, database structure, API specs, diagrams etc.
- **Delivery**: outlines how you intend to roll out the new feature or project. Deployment, potential roll-back, test cases are all detailed here.
- **Success Criteria**: measuring the success of a new product feature or project. How do we determine success.
