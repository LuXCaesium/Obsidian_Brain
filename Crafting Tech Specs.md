# Crafting Tech Specs

A Tech Specs document, is a detailed description to outline the technical and functional aspects of a product feature, system or project. This is meant to provide clear and comprehensive information about technical requirements and guidelines.

This includes:

- 🎯 **Clarity of Vision**: Provide clear understanding of what needs to be built, ensuring everyone is working toward the same goals.
- 🔗 **Better Communication**: Common language between team, helping bridge the gap between technical & non-technical stakeholders.
- 🚧 **Risk Mitigation**: Detailed specs to help identify potential issues early, and plan ways to mitigate them.
- 📈 **Efficiency in Development**: With a well defined plan, development is smoother, as developers have a clear road map to follow.
- 🔍 **Quality Assurance**: Define quality standards, guiding testing to ensure the final product meets all requirements.
