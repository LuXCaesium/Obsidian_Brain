# Reactive Programming and ReactiveX

So what is reactive programming ? It is a way to write event driven code. The name comes from the fact that a reactive code is composed of entities that react to events being emitted by sources. These entities apply transformations on these events, and return other events as a result. So these entities - named _operators_ - can be chained together, to create computation graphs.

Reactive computation graphs are always directed. They flow in only one way. Some graphs are _Directed Acyclic Graphs_ - DAG - like this one:

![[graph_dag.png | center | 200]]

On this diagram the nodes represent computations, and the edge the link between computations.

Some graphs may also be Cycle Graphs like this one:
![[graph_cycle.png|center|200]]
Cycle graphs are very common when writing a fully reactive application. Most of the time the major part of an application graph is acyclic, and a sub-part may have cycles.

[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) is the most popular implementation of Reactive Programming libraries. One reason is that it was one of the firsts reactive libraries. It was initially developed by Microsoft for the .net platform. Since 2012 the code is open source, and has been ported to more than 20 programming languages.

The python implementation of ReactiveX is [RxPY](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY). The library is available on pypi and can be installed with pip:

```python
pip3 install rx
```

## Observable, Observer, Operator

The foundation of ReactiveX is based on only a few key principles described in the [Observable Contract](http://reactivex.io/documentation/contract.html).

The base entity in ReactiveX is the **Observable**. An Observable is an entity that is a source of **items**. Item is the ReactiveX term for an event. One could consider and Observable to be a stream of events.

The second entity is the **Observer**. And Observer is the entity that **subscribes** to observers, so that it can process items as they are emitted. The subscription to an observable is explicit, meaning an observable does not emit items until an observer subscribes to it. When an observable is created, no data flows, it only flows when subscribed to.

We can then combine an Observer and an Observable to create an **Operator**. An operator subscribes to a source Observable, applies some transformations to the incoming items, an emits new items on another Observable.

## Marble Diagrams

Motto: A by example way to represent the behaviour of an operator.

Consider the *map* operator, taking items from a source observable, applying a transformation, and returning a sink observable with the transformation function applied to the source items. The marble diagram below explain this:

![[map_marble.png]]

There are three parts to this diagram:
- The top arrow represents the source observable: When being subscribed, this source observable emits the numbers 1 to 4
- The rectangle represents the computation done by the operator. In this example, one is subtracted to each received item.
- The bottom arrow represents the sink Observable. As a result of subtracting 1 to each item, it emits items 0 to 3.

Time increases from left to right and the arrows can have difference endings indicating difference ways that the observable completes:

A Line ending with an arrow means that the Observable will continue to emit items in the future. Circles on the line are time positions when items are emitted.

![[observable.png]]

A line ending with a pipe - | - indicates that the Observable completes on success. No more items can be emitted after.

A line ending with a cross - X - indicates that the Observable completes on error. No more items can be emitted after.

## Reactivity Diagrams

Reactivity diagrams are another kind of visualization. They are used to describe the behavior of an application or a component. They are similar to [UML Activity Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram), but they describe a data flow instead of a control flow. Let's consider a simple application that takes a source observable as input, decrease the value, and keep only even values. Here is the reactivity diagram of this application:

![[reactivity_demo1.png|200]]

The black circle indicates a source Observable. The rounded rectangles are operators. Here we chain two operators: _map_ and _filter_. The encircled black circle is a sink of the data flow.

More complex graphs can be described in a similar way. Reactivity diagrams are a good way to work on architecture before coding. See here another simple example with a cycle graph:

![[reactivity_demo2.png|200]]

## Code

We need two imports to use the ReactiveX operators:
```python
import rx
import rx.operators as ops
```
The first import is to use utility functions and factory operators. Factory operators are operators that create Observable from an external source of data instead of an Observable. The second import is a shortcut for using all other operators.

The first step is to create a source Observable. We do not use real data here, but instead we create an Observable from a list. This is done with the _from_iterable_ factory operator:

```python
source = rx.from_iterable([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Then we build the computation graph. This one is composed of two operators: _map_ and _filter_.

```python
source.pipe(
    ops.map(lambda i: i - 1),
    ops.filter(lambda i: i % 2 == 0),
)
```

The pipe operator allows to chain other operators. It is an easy and readable way to create graphs. The _map_ and _filter_ operators take functions as parameters. We use lambdas here for these simple computations.

You can execute this code already. However, remember that nothing will happen yet: The graph is created but nobody subscribed to it, so no data flows yet. Let's do that to consume the source observable:

```python
source.pipe(
    ops.map(lambda i: i - 1),
    ops.filter(lambda i: i % 2 == 0),
).subscribe(
    on_next=lambda i: print("on_next: {}".format(i)),
    on_completed=lambda: print("on_completed"),
    on_error=lambda e: print("on_error: {}".format(e))
)
```

The subscribe method... subscribes to an observable. It takes three callbacks as arguments. These callbacks will be called at different times:

-   _on_next_ is called each time an item is received.
-   _on_completed_ is called when the observable completes on success.
-   _on_error_ is called when the Observable completes on error.

Note that according to the Observable Contract, the _on_next_ callback will never be called after the _on_completed_ and the _on_error_ callbacks.

There is a final step needed to clean up the resources on completion. The subscription creates some resources. These resources have to be cleaned up when they are not needed anymore. For this, the subscribe method returns a **Disposable** object. The _dispose_ method of this Disposable object can be called to clean up these resources:

```python
import rx
import rx.operators as ops

source = rx.from_iterable([1, 2, 3, 4])

disposable = source.pipe(
    ops.map(lambda i: i - 1),
    ops.filter(lambda i: i % 2 == 0),
).subscribe(
    on_next=lambda i: print("on_next: {}".format(i)),
    on_completed=lambda: print("on_completed"),
    on_error=lambda e: print("on_error: {}".format(e)),
)

disposable.dispose()
print("Done!")
```

## Error Management
As a consequence, here is the behavior of our application: Each time an item is emitted, it goes through the happy path of the map operator (i.e. its value is decreased). If all goes well, the resulting item continues on the happy path of the filter operator. On success, the on_next callback is called.

In case of error in the map function, the map operator catches the exception, and emits it on the error path. The exception is forwarded to the error path of the filter operator. The filter operator just forwards it downstream, and the on_error callback is called.

So operators deal explicitly with errors. There are also some operators dedicated to error management, such as retrying subscriptions, or generating errors on timeout.

The great thing with this structure is that in many cases, you have error management for free. For people using functional programming, this is an implementation of the Try monad.
