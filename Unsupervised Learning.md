# Unsupervised Learning

In contrast to the supervised case, where a *response* variable $y$ is explained by an explanatory vector $x$, in unsupervised learning there is no response variable. So instead the overall goal is to extract useful information & patterns from the data. We ultimately aim to learn about the underlying probability distribution of the data.
